# 32bit-ALU-ComputerArchitecture
Configurable 32-bit ALU design with status flag handling in C++
# üßÆ 32-bit Configurable Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in C++

This project implements a configurable 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using C++. The ALU is capable of executing a variety of arithmetic and logical operations and includes support for status flag handling such as zero, carry, overflow, and sign.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

The ALU module simulates how modern processors execute low-level operations. It includes:

- Support for **32-bit integer operations**
- **Arithmetic**: addition, subtraction, multiplication
- **Logical**: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR
- **Comparison operations**
- **Shift operations** (left, right)
- Generation of **status flags**: 
  - **Zero Flag (ZF)**: Result is zero
  - **Carry Flag (CF)**: Overflow in unsigned operations
  - **Overflow Flag (OF)**: Overflow in signed operations
  - **Sign Flag (SF)**: Result is negative

## üìå Usage

1. Open `ALUProject.cpp` in any C++ IDE (such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Compile and run the code.
3. Follow the console output to see sample ALU operations and their flag results.
